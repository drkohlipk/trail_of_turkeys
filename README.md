# Trail of Turkeys
This was a project created during our time at Coding Dojo.  It is currently built using Python and Django as a back-end and standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the front-end.  This project is still under construction and is being ported to the Unity game engine where it will be completed using C#.
