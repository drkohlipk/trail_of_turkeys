# Trail of Turkeys
This was a project created during our time at Coding Dojo.  It is currently built using Python and Django as a back-end and standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the front-end.  This project is still under construction and is being ported to the Unity game engine where it will be completed using C#.

This game is based on the popular 1990s game Oregon Trail and is set around the Thanksgiving adventure of traveling over the river and through the woods to Grandmother's house where you will have dinner with your extended family and partake in Thanksgiving festivities.  Along the route to Grandmother's house, you will face trials and tribulations that will test whether or not you can become the a true Turkey-day warrior!

Currently, this project is deployed using AWS's EC2 and only contains the Thanksgiving challenge of Turkey Blackjack.  However, you can check out this project at the following link:

Stay tuned and we will keep you updated as to the progress of the game!

Thank you for visiting!
